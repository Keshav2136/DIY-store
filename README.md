# DIY-store

                                   [This project is still under process and a lot has to be updated.]

This project is intended for those who want DO-IT-YOURSELF stuff right in their hands so that they can make further changes to that or just have fun saving time and energy.

From the last many days I was thinking to create my very personal drone/quadcopter/UAV.
I started by creating a whatsapp group and added some tech enthusiasts who could help me. I studied the concept of how a drone actuall$

Concept of working of a drone:
 - When the propellors of the quadcopter rotate they push air downward which causes the drone to lift up. As a result we can make the the drone go in any direction and height by controlling motor's speed.

[*] As it would be a quadcopter, failing of even a single motor means crashing of the whole drone.
[*] If we go on to create a hexacopter which has 6 motors, failing of a motor will have very slight effect on the flight and we could easily make the drone to come down and prevent it from crashing.
